"### Step 1: Identify Consistent and Robust Rule Patterns\n\n#### Diagnosis = 0:\n- **MMSE**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: MMSE > 18.77, MMSE > 16.20\n  - Consensus interval: MMSE > mean(16.20, 18.77) = 17.485 (We round this value to a reasonable precision, say 17.50 for simplicity.)\n\n- **PhysicalActivity**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1 and 3, 4: PhysicalActivity > 3.41\n  - Majority consensus indicates PhysicalActivity > 3.41 is robust.\n\n- **ADL**:\n  - From Rule Sets 2, 3, and 5: ADL > 3.18\n  - Consensus interval: ADL > 3.18\n\n- **DiastolicBP**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: DiastolicBP ≤ 85.00\n  - Consensus interval: DiastolicBP ≤ 85.00\n\n- **DietQuality**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: DietQuality ≤ 2.75\n  - Consensus interval: DietQuality ≤ 2.75\n\n- **Smoking**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 3, and 5: Smoking > 0.50\n  - Consensus interval: Smoking > 0.50 (though not as strong a consensus, it appears in 3/5)\n\n#### Diagnosis = 1:\n- **MMSE**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: MMSE ≤ 18.77, MMSE ≤ 16.20\n  - Consensus interval: MMSE ≤ mean(16.20, 18.77) = 17.485 (We round this value to a reasonable precision, say 17.50 for simplicity.)\n\n- **PhysicalActivity**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: PhysicalActivity ≤ 3.41\n  - Consensus interval: PhysicalActivity ≤ 3.41\n\n- **ADL**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: ADL ≤ 3.18\n  - Consensus interval: ADL ≤ 3.18\n\n- **DiastolicBP**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: DiastolicBP > 85.00 or DiastolicBP ≤ 85.00\n  - This condition shows variability, but DiastolicBP > 85.00 shows up often for Diagnosis = 1.\n\n- **DietQuality**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: DietQuality > 2.75\n  - Consensus interval: DietQuality > 2.75\n\n- **Smoking**:\n  - From Rule Sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: Smoking ≤ 0.50\n  - Consensus interval: Smoking ≤ 0.50\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Single Consistent Interval-based Rule Set (Self-consistency)\n\n### Final Integrated Rule Set\n\n- **If Diagnosis = 0**, then:\n  - MMSE > 17.50 and\n  - (PhysicalActivity > 3.41 or ADL > 3.18 or Smoking > 0.50) and\n  - DiastolicBP ≤ 85.00 and\n  - DietQuality ≤ 2.75\n\n- **If Diagnosis = 1**, then:\n  - MMSE ≤ 17.50 and\n  - PhysicalActivity ≤ 3.41 and\n  - ADL ≤ 3.18 and\n  - DiastolicBP > 85.00 and\n  - DietQuality > 2.75 and\n  - Smoking ≤ 0.50\n\n### Summary\nWhen Diagnosis = 0:\n- MMSE is typically above 17.50.\n- PhysicalActivity is often higher than 3.41, or ADL is above 3.18, or Smoking is above 0.50.\n- DiastolicBP is generally 85.00 or below.\n- DietQuality is usually 2.75 or below.\n\nWhen Diagnosis = 1:\n- MMSE is typically 17.50 or below.\n- PhysicalActivity is 3.41 or below.\n- ADL is 3.18 or below.\n- DiastolicBP is often above 85.00.\n- DietQuality is usually above 2.75.\n- Smoking is 0.50 or below.\n\nThese conditions summarize the stable and consistent patterns observed across the rule sets, providing a reliable basis for further analysis or data generation."
