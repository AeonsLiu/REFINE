"### Step 1: Parse Nested If-Else Logic into Flat Rule Format\n\n#### If-Else Structure Sample 1:\n**Flattened Rules:**\n1. If Diagnosis = 1, then MMSE <= 18.77 and PhysicalActivity <= 3.41 and Smoking <= 0.50.\n2. If Diagnosis = 1, then MMSE <= 18.77 and PhysicalActivity > 3.41 and ADL <= 3.18.\n3. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE > 18.77.\n4. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE <= 18.77 and PhysicalActivity <= 3.41 and Smoking > 0.50.\n5. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE <= 18.77 and PhysicalActivity > 3.41 and ADL > 3.18.\n\n---\n\n#### If-Else Structure Sample 2:\n**Flattened Rules:**\n1. If Diagnosis = 1, then MMSE <= 16.20 and MMSE <= 9.21 and ADL <= 3.18.\n2. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE <= 16.20 and MMSE <= 9.21 and ADL > 3.18.\n3. If Diagnosis = 1, then MMSE <= 16.20 and MMSE > 9.21.\n4. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE > 16.20.\n\n---\n\n#### If-Else Structure Sample 3:\n**Flattened Rules:**\n1. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE <= 15.64 and DiastolicBP <= 85.00 and DietQuality <= 2.75.\n2. If Diagnosis = 1, then MMSE <= 15.64 and DiastolicBP <= 85.00 and DietQuality > 2.75.\n3. If Diagnosis = 1, then MMSE <= 15.64 and DiastolicBP > 85.00.\n4. If Diagnosis = 0, then MMSE > 15.64.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Merge Similar Diagnosis Rules Across Samples\n\n#### For Diagnosis = 1:\n**Key Features and Conditions Across Samples:**\n- MMSE:\n  - MMSE <= 18.77 (Sample 1)\n  - MMSE <= 16.20 (Sample 2)\n  - MMSE <= 15.64 (Sample 3)\n- PhysicalActivity:\n  - PhysicalActivity <= 3.41 (Sample 1)\n- Smoking:\n  - Smoking <= 0.50 (Sample 1)\n- ADL:\n  - ADL <= 3.18 (Samples 1 & 2)\n- DiastolicBP:\n  - DiastolicBP > 85.00 (Sample 3)\n- DietQuality:\n  - DietQuality > 2.75 (Sample 3)\n\n**Merged Rule for Diagnosis = 1:**\n- MMSE <= 18.77 (generalizing across all samples)\n- PhysicalActivity <= 3.41 (where relevant)\n- Smoking <= 0.50 OR ADL <= 3.18 OR DietQuality > 2.75 (capturing distinct paths)\n- DiastolicBP > 85.00 (only relevant from Sample 3)\n\n---\n\n#### For Diagnosis = 0:\n**Key Features and Conditions Across Samples:**\n- MMSE:\n  - MMSE > 18.77 (Sample 1)\n  - MMSE > 16.20 (Sample 2)\n  - MMSE > 15.64 (Sample 3)\n- Smoking:\n  - Smoking > 0.50 (Sample 1)\n- ADL:\n  - ADL > 3.18 (Samples 1 & 2)\n- DiastolicBP:\n  - DiastolicBP <= 85.00 (Sample 3)\n- DietQuality:\n  - DietQuality <= 2.75 (Sample 3)\n\n**Merged Rule for Diagnosis = 0:**\n- MMSE > 18.77 OR MMSE > 16.20 OR MMSE > 15.64 (generalizing MMSE thresholds to the most inclusive form)\n- Smoking > 0.50 OR ADL > 3.18 OR DietQuality <= 2.75 (capturing distinct paths)\n- DiastolicBP <= 85.00 (where relevant)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Rule Set (Focused on Key Features)\n\n**Final Rules:**\n\n- **If Diagnosis = 1, then** MMSE <= 18.77 and (PhysicalActivity <= 3.41 or Smoking <= 0.50 or ADL <= 3.18 or DietQuality > 2.75 or DiastolicBP > 85.00).\n- **If Diagnosis = 0, then** MMSE > 15.64 and (Smoking > 0.50 or ADL > 3.18 or DietQuality <= 2.75 or DiastolicBP <= 85.00).\n\n---\n\n### Key Highlights:\n1. **Features Included:** MMSE, PhysicalActivity, Smoking, ADL, DietQuality, DiastolicBP.\n2. **Clear Differentiation:** Diagnosis 1 prioritizes lower MMSE, while Diagnosis 0 captures higher MMSE thresholds.\n3. **Overlaps Handled:** Overlapping conditions use inclusive operators.\n4. **Generalization:** Broadened conditions where possible, ensuring all samples are represented."
