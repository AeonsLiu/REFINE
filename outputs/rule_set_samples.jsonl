### Rule set 2
#### Final Rule for Diagnosis = 0:
- If Diagnosis = 0, then **MMSE > 16.20**, **ADL > 3.18**, **DiastolicBP <= 85.00**, and **DietQuality <= 2.75**.

#### Final Rule for Diagnosis = 1:
- If Diagnosis = 1, then **MMSE <= 16.20**, **ADL <= 3.18**, **DiastolicBP > 85.00 or DietQuality > 2.75**, **PhysicalActivity <= 3.41**, and **Smoking <= 0.50**.


### Rule Set 3:
#### Final Rules:
- **If Diagnosis = 0**, then MMSE > 16.20 and (PhysicalActivity > 3.41 or ADL > 3.18 or Smoking > 0.50) and DiastolicBP ≤ 85.00 and DietQuality ≤ 2.75
- **If Diagnosis = 1**, then MMSE ≤ 16.20 and (PhysicalActivity ≤ 3.41 or ADL ≤ 3.18) and DiastolicBP > 85.00 and DietQuality > 2.75


### Rule Set 4:
**Diagnosis = 1:**
- If `MMSE <= 18.77` and:
  - `PhysicalActivity <= 3.41` and `Smoking <= 0.50`
  - Or `PhysicalActivity > 3.41` and `ADL <= 3.18`
  - Or `DiastolicBP <= 85.00` and `DietQuality > 2.75`
  - Or `DiastolicBP > 85.00`

**Diagnosis = 0:**
- If `MMSE > 18.77`
- Or `MMSE <= 18.77` and:
  - `PhysicalActivity <= 3.41` and `Smoking > 0.50`
  - Or `PhysicalActivity > 3.41` and `ADL > 3.18`
  - Or `DiastolicBP <= 85.00` and `DietQuality <= 2.75`


### Rule Set 5:
- **If Diagnosis = 1, then** MMSE <= 18.77 and (PhysicalActivity <= 3.41 or Smoking <= 0.50 or ADL <= 3.18 or DietQuality > 2.75 or DiastolicBP > 85.00).
- **If Diagnosis = 0, then** MMSE > 15.64 and (Smoking > 0.50 or ADL > 3.18 or DietQuality <= 2.75 or DiastolicBP <= 85.00).
